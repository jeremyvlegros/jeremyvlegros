## Content

I have eclectic tastes, but mostly the content will be about programming, video games, technology, and me.

## My website goals

### A reliable website

- no cookies prompt from me
- no advertisements from me
- no `JavaScript` requirement from me
- no money related things
- no data analytics
- no fuss such as comments, likes
- privileging text over images

### Transparency & being useful

- people can see the post history
- people can read my code
- people can see my coding struggles and learn from those I solved
- sharing links

### Safeguard / backup

- anybody can download the whole website
- GitHub commits act as creation proof
- have an online access to some of my data

### More independence × flexibility

- I create the post format that I need
- I can add functionalities
- building × drafting × testing my workshop system
