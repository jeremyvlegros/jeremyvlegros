## License

I, Jeremy Legros, keep ownership of things I write.

If you use this repository, you use it at your own risks.

The MIT `Minima` code license is not included in the directory because :
- there are no substantial portion of codes
- the theme is loaded from `GitHub`

The `Dracula` `CSS` theme :
- is licensed
- the `CSS` contains the MIT license header

## I modded the `Minima` theme extensively

This repository is not a good example of a custom `Minima` theme.

As for the why :
- I ~~had my share of~~ have to search, find, then read lots of documentation
- keeping some independence :
  - if `GitHub` stops using `Jekyll`
  - if I need to migrate the website
  - dependencies are a serious problem, it wastes a lot of my time :
    - maintenance Ã— documentation
    - modified dependencies not stated as modified
    - dependencies that are not stated as dependencies in the documentation
    - dependent documentation forwarding to the dependency documentation
- I know my code, I can modify it
- paradoxically, to have a minimal theme
