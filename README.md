# License

I, Jeremy Legros, keep ownership of things I write.

If you use this repository, you use it at your own risks.

The `Minima` code is licensed by a MIT license (`_layouts`, `_includes`).The license is not included in the directory because :

- it is not a substantial portion of code
- most `Minima` files are empty

The `Dracula` `CSS` theme :
- is licensed
- the `CSS` contains the MIT license header

# This repository is not a good example of a custom Minima but an overwritten one

I broke the `Minima` theme voluntarily, I use my own `CSS`.

As for the why :
- I ~~had my share of~~ have to search, find, then read lots of documentation
- keeping some independence :
  - if `GitHub` stops using `Jekyll`
  - if I need to migrate the website
  - dependencies are a serious problem, it wastes a lot of my time :
    - maintenance Ã— documentation
    - modified dependencies not stated as modified
    - dependencies that are not stated as dependencies in the documentation
    - dependent documentation forwarding to the dependency documentation
- I know my code, I can modify it
- paradoxically, to have a minimal theme

# My website goals
- no cookies prompt from me (things such as video players can still ask for cookies)
- no external advertisements, promoting only my stuff
- no hosted paid things
- post history
- no obfuscated code
- no `JavaScript` needed to browse the website (external things can ask for it, but the website won't be broke without `JavaScript`)
- have more control on how I write posts
- reserving social media platforms for communication
- safeguard / backup
