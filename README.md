# My website goals :
- no cookies (things can still ask cookies such as video players, but it will not be me, and I'll try to not let that happen)
- no external advertisements, promoting only my stuff 
- free
- paid things elsewhere
- idealy no use of javascript, but if really needed using it as little as possible  
- to stop posting on social media platforms
- trying to reserve social media platforms for communication 

## For people cloning this repository

### I broke the minima theme voluntarily

I use my own CSS.

This repository is not a good example of a custom Minima, but more as a overwritten one

### This repository is not licensed, and not "unlicensed"

I keep ownership of things I write

The Minima code is licensed by a MIT licence (_layouts, minima_includes) which is not included in the directory because it is not a substantial portion of code, and I don't really use it

The Dracula CSS theme is licensed, and the CSS contains the MIT license header
