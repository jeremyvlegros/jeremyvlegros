## License

I, Jeremy Legros, keep ownership of things I write.

If you use this repository, you use it at your own risks.

## Minima

I constructed the website using the `Minima` theme as a template, I don't use it anymore.

The remaining similarities are mostly : 
- file names
- `CSS` class names (I don't use any `CSS` from the the theme)

As there are no substantial portion of codes therefore I won't include The `MIT LICENCE` for the `Minima` theme

## Dracula syntax highlighting

The `Dracula` `CSS` theme is licensed (the `CSS` contains the `MIT license`)
