I installed `Jekyll` :
- it just became impossible without more feedback, now I get the build error, the error, the error line
- I can program offline with faster builds ~ 1/2 second against sometimes 3 minutes on `GitHub`
- I wasn't sure of the software until today, it needed comparisons and testing, the version being 4 offline and 3 on `GitHub`
