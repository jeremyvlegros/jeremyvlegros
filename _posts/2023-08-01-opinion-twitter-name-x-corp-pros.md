Having a trademark described in one letter would be cool, a __`x`__ being undefined, it could rassemble many products, but ... it is not __`X`__ it's __`X corp`__.

Other thing(s ?) from the owner are already in __`X`__ such as __`Space X`__ (why not  __`Corporation X`__ though ? I would have been consistent )
