__`Minecraft`__ updates, new biomes, new mobs always makes me happier :

- a free update every here and then up to this day
- a massive update once a year
- a mob vote each year for one out of three

But : 
- updates focus too much on the world structure and too little in filling them with life, resulting in pretty static empty landscapes
- each year the wait for the next __`Minecraft live`__, then the wait for the update implementation, then playing for a bit, then the wait for the next __`Minecraft live`__ ...

During these 10 years of __`Minecraft`__ updates, the game rarely felt alive.

__`Mojang`__ is accountable for the content they release, paid content _and_ free content.

It is a disturbing relationship between the community and __`Mojang`__, the community being lit on fire and __`Mojang`__ remaining silent.
