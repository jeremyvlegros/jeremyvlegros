`Minecraft` updates, new biomes, new mobs always makes me happier :

- a free update every here and then up to this day
- a massive update once a year
- a mob vote each year for one out of three

But : 
- updates focus too much on the world structure and too little in filling them with life, resulting in pretty static empty landscapes
- each year the wait for the next `Minecraft live`, then the wait for the update implementation, then playing for a bit, then the wait for the next `Minecraft live` ...

During these 10 years of `Minecraft` updates, the game rarely felt alive.

`Mojang` is accountable for the content they release, paid content _and_ free content.

It is a disturbing relationship between the community and `Mojang`, the community being lit on fire and `Mojang` remaining silent.
