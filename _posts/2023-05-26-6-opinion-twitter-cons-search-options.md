- can’t search for people anymore (it is less public,you can watch the explore without
- can’t have any control on what is displayed, because there is no choice but the front page
- can’t do anything with the hashtags
- can’t watch the pictures of a person in “Media” (but still can click on the picture gallery thing on the right ... don't ask me)
