My name is Jeremy Legros, I am French, 38 years old, with a background in computer science.

### My day job

- self-employed, helping people with anything computer related, this is my day job when I get calls
- still relying on the help of the government and my parents
- certainly not proud to be in this situation, constantly filled with anxiety and guilt, but I keep pushing forward to a future where I can be happy.

### Building my dream job

I donâ€™t have a name for my dream job, either than it would fit me, being basically built from and with me, built in multiple parts :

- registering what I do
- automating the workflow by creating tools and a system similar to a pipeline
- publishing content 
- documentating everything

In the one goal of sponsoring my dream job of modding video-games.

#### *Surviving "happy" or surviving "unhappy" ?*

My life won't have meaning if I don't live it as myself.
