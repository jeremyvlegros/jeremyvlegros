## Original plan : a HUB

At the time I wanted to use `Twitter` as a HUB and `Tumblr` as a blog.
 
One problem though, my access to `Tumblr` was bugged asking for a cookie panel prompt I kept accepting.

So `Twitter` became an all-in-one solution.

## Now

I will do mostly what companies do, i.e. re-directions to their website/products/store.

The weather forecast on my personal life has become clouded, I am less about ethics than usual

I want to keep my handle, and to keep it, I need to post, so I'll stay on `Twitter`

I discovered a way to optimize the use of `Twitter`

I obtained a shard of courage, and started writing my website
