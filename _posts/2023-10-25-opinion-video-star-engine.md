I don't know if __`Star Citizen`__ will look that good, but if it does, I can imagine some developers adding __`Star Citizen`__ as an anomaly :
- half of the features in this video are what every AAA space video game must have
- the other half left me in total disbelief ... is that ... what ?
- I was sold three minutes in, and it kept going, showing other features for 23 more minutes

If this doesn't wake up players I don't know what will, this is the kind of technology you would pay 70â‚¬ for.
