It will constrast with my website, appearing as even more peaceful, from surfing the web as  paddling in an ocean of :
- ads
- face hugger videos
- hidden video controls
- face hugger windows
- obscure closing buttons (left, right, button okay ? button dismiss ?)
- the button to refuse cookies "do no accept cookies" is either : 
  - written discreetly
  - requiring un-toggling 10 elements, because there are no "refuse all cookies"
  
to none of that on my website.
