## I won't use Twitter as a blog anymore

---

- Business won, both ways I guess.

- I will do mostly what companies do, i.e. re-directions to their site/products.

- I will follow only company accounts, not people

- I still be there for pressing the "like" button from time to time


## Original plan : a HUB

---

At the time I wanted to use `Twitter` as a HUB and `Tumblr` as a blog.

One problem though, but my access to `Tumblr` was bugged with an empty page loading indefinitely, prompting a cookie panel I kept accepting …

So `Twitter` became a all-in-one solution.


## What Twitter still has

---

- public access to a timeline (still being bugged with sign-in prompts, but it's much better than other platforms)
- interaction with strangers, including known people
- lots of people
- lots of known people
- lots of companies
- buttons, "like", "bookmark", maybe I can find a use for the "retweet"
- some communication safeguards that I like :
	- can choose who can respond to posts (made me come back at the time)
	- can choose who can message me by setting on only accounts I follow

## What changed

---

### 1) Twitter

#### People without accounts

- have are no more search options :
	- can’t search for people anymore (it is less public,you can watch the explore without
	- have any control on what is displayed, because there is no choice but the front page
	- can use a web search engine to find people, so ... why ?
	- can't do anything with the hashtags
	- can’t watch the pictures of a person in “Media”, but still can click on the picture gallery thing on the right (don't ask me why ...)

#### The API is restricted

- I don’t have to ask that to myself anymore, it’s one less problem
- there is a free version

#### Some unique features are gone

- short posts, embedding media effortlessly, with a preview
- verified identity on Twitter was like existing official on the web
- my `Tumblr` link to the first version of this post, no longer has a preview :
	- That's one less pros argument ...
	- I didn't want to use my website link because It has no preview, but now that it is the same, let's finish the social exodus.

#### Policy (?)

- The direction `Twitter` is going
- The CEO is new but ... the old CEO is still around, sitting not far
- `Twitter` decides what is okay or not and I can't do anything about it, it is in the terms of use (I believe)


### 2) I tried Tumblr

- posting there made me realize that social platforms should be only be about social, about human networking
- posting is more complete than Twitter but not polished
- the website builder gave me the taste of freedom, but :
	- it asks for cookies and sign-up
	- adult bots liking my posts, and showing on the post likes ...
	- I want more flexibility, even the HTML posting format is constrained

### 3) Me

- the weather forecast on my personal life has become clouded with dark gray clouds, I am less about ethics than usual, the business side won.
- I want to keep my handle, I need to post, there are rumors about inactive accounts being ...
- I discovered a way to optimize the use of `Twitter`
- I want more functionalities and why should I wait for them, when I can write them
- I obtained a shard of courage, and started writing my website
