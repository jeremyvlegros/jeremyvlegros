I was still okay with `Twitter`, even when it required login, I still have ways to use it,
but when it got rename `X`, it became scary, because :
- of how it was done :
    - inconsistant rebranding :
        - someparts are kept as `Twitter` and some parts named `X`
        - the blue color is still there, whereas the logo is black and white
        - the website address is `Twitter` :
            - whereas the website is named `X`
            - typing `www.x.com` redirects to `Twitter`, why didn't they do it in one go ?
        - the handle `Twitter` was not replaced by `X`, I don't know if it still the case
    - for a company this big to do that quality of a rebranding, worries me enough to change my plans about it

- what's with the `X corp` brand ? To me it :
  - feels unorganic
  - feels like a villain company name in a movie :
    - had them use `Corp X` I wouldn't have felt this way, but still, it's a blogging (?) platform
    - my guess is that the `X` brand was too generic to be trademarked (which would have been cool), they had to add more letters, squeezing the swag out of it, but they still went with it ...
    - I understand `Space X` because ... it has space in it, but `X` and `X corp` ?
    - the black and white color feels serious against the conviality of the blue color
