It just became impossible without more feedback, error details : 
- before testing on `Github` 
- in which file
- in which line (not always)
- now I can program offline with faster builds ~ 1/2 second against sometimes 3 minutes on `GitHub`
- I wasn't sure of the software until today, it needed comparisons and testing, the version being 4 offline and 3 on `GitHub`
