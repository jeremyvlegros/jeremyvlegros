## I won't vote until they make changes.

It is not okay : 
- to choose 1 mob then lose 2 mobs forever
- to choose 1 mob then lose 2 functionalities forever
- to choose 1 mob we don't like to get 1 functionality
- to farm players' hopes into content for a presentation
- to call a vote with a lack of information
- to make players choose for 1 mob and 1 feature per year that can be done by 1 modder in a matter of hours without the game source code

Voting for something to be added for sure in the game is a priviledge,
but doing so with a chance a 33.33% is done at the cost of distress.

This is not what `Minecraft` is about.
