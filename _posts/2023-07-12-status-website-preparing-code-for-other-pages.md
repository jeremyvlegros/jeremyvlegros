The timeline page code is cleaned, using __`.liquid`__ files from __`_include`__, I call them __`Liquid`__ functions.

I had to dive deeper into __`Jekyll `__ and __`Liquid`__, into __`include`__ and __`capture`__.

Many pages (and future pages) depend on __`Liquid`__ functions, as of now it should be much easier and cleaner. 

remark :
- the "functions" are lousy based on my naming convention
