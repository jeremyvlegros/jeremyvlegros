The timeline page code is cleaned, using `.liquid` files from `_include`, files that I call `Liquid` functions.

I had to dive deeper into `Jekyll` and `Liquid`, couldn't continue without understanding `include` and `capture`.

Many of the `Liquid` functions I wrote are needed to construct the other pages I have in mind, but it should be much easier and cleaner. 

remarks : 
- I still have to clean the post layout
- the "functions" are lousy based on my naming convention, but it still helped me a lot
