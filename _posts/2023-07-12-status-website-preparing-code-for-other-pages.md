The timeline page code is cleaned, using `.liquid` files from `_include`, I call them `Liquid` functions.

I had to dive deeper into `Jekyll` and `Liquid`, into `include` and `capture`.

Many pages (and future pages) depend on `Liquid` functions, as of now it should be much easier and cleaner. 

remark :
- the "functions" are lousy based on my naming convention
