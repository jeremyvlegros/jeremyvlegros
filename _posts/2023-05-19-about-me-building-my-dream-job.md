## *Surviving "happy" or surviving "unhappy" ?*

My life won't have meaning if I don't live it ... as myself.

I donâ€™t have a name for my dream job, either than it would fit me, being basically built from and with me, built in multiple parts :

- registering what I do
- automating the workflow by creating tools and a system similar to a pipeline
- publishing content 
- documentating everything

In the one goal of sponsoring my dream job of modding video-games.
