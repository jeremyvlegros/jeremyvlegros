It feels unorganic. It doesn't fit in a social experience :  
- black and white color, it feels ominous
- `X` ? `x` is used for undefined things ... and for adult things

I think that the `X` brand was too generic to be trademarked as it is, they needed more letters, which squeezed the swag out of the name.
