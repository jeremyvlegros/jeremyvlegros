## A reliable simple website

- no cookies prompt from me
- no advertisements from me, except unadvertised links in the form of a ~ "more" link
- no `JavaScript` requirement from me
- no money related things on the website
- no data analytics on the website
- no comments, likes, re-blog, retweets on the website
- no visible images except from sources such as video players
- no mouse hover prompts, such as tips

## Transparency & being useful

- people can see the post history

- code is text :
	- syntax colored
	- copy-able, hence, testable

- people can see my coding struggles :
	- the ones I solved
	- the ones I didn't solve
	- extract knowledge from them

- links :
	- referencing things that I deem important or useful :
		- articles
		- videos
		- people
		- video game mods
	- creating an online hub for myself

## Safeguard / backup

- anybody can download the whole website
- GitHub commits act as creation proof
- online access to some of my data

## More independence × flexibility

- I create the post format that I need
- I can add functionalities
- building × drafting × testing my workshop system

## The `Read me`
