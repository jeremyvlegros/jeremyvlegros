The original plan was to use __`Twitter`__ as a HUB and __`Tumblr`__ as a blog.
 
One problem though, my access to __`Tumblr`__ was bugged asking for cookies forever ... hence __`Twitter`__ became an all-in-one solution.

Now I am reconsidering :

- The weather forecast on my personal life has become clouded, I am less about ethics than usual

- I obtained a shard of courage, and started writing my website

- I want to keep my handle, and to keep it, I need to post, so I'll stay on __`Twitter`__
 
- I will do mostly what companies do, i.e. re-directions to their website/products/store.

- I discovered a way to optimize the use of __`Twitter`__
