## Reasons

### `Twitter` is closing on itself

I can't see tweets, accounts, or even the main page without being logged in :
- what's the point of `Twitter` if it becomes accessible only to `Twitter` users ...
- It makes even less sense for advertisements, it limits them to `Twitter` users ... isn't this counter productive ?

If it stays that way ... I don't think I won't even post "post links" there, it will just be work ...

### I like seeing if people click on my links

Yep, the only reason I will use `linkt.ree` is ego boosting.

### Contrasting my website and the outside web

Surfing the web has become paddling in an ocean of :
- ads
- face hugger videos
- hidden video controls
- face hugger windows
- obscure closing buttons (left, right, button okay ? button dismiss ?)
- the button to refuse cookies "do no accept cookies" is either : 
  - written discreetly
  - requiring un-toggling 10 elements because a there are no "refuse all cookies"
  
I will contribute to this ocean, to hammer the nail in the ~~personal data exploitation~~ personalized experience, that way it will contrast even more with my website.

### Blending in ?

Crazy is not crazy if everybody is crazy.

Doing the same craziness as in a crazy world is a relief where I feel less crazy doing the same craziness.
