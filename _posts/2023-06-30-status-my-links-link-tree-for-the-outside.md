I decided to use `Linktr.ee` for links that are hosted outside of this website.

## Reason 1 > `Twitter` closed on itself ?

I can't see tweets, accounts, or even the main page without being logged in :
- I don't know if it is only me
- I don't know if it is temporary
- what's the point of `Twitter` if it becomes accessible only to `Twitter` users ...
- It makes even less sense for advertisements, it limits them to `Twitter` users ... isn't this counter productive ?

I won't wait for my answer ...

But if it stays that way ... I don't think I won't even "post links" there.

## Reason 2 > I like seeing if people click on my links

Yep, the only reason I will use `linkt.ree` is ego boosting.

## Reason 3 > Contrasting my website and the outside web

Surfing the web has become paddling in an ocean of ads, searching for the "do no accept cookies" :
- written discreetly
- opening cookie settings and un-toggling 10 elements to refuse cookies, because there are no "refuse all"
- videos popping, playing, with hidden controls ...

windows popping out and requiring to find where the closing button is (left, right, button okay ? button dismiss ?).

I will contribute to the web ~~personal data exploitation~~ personalized experience, to contrast with my website.

## Reason 4 > Blending in ?

Crazy is not crazy if everybody is crazy.

Doing the same craziness as in a crazy world is a relief where I feel less crazy doing the same craziness.
