## Reasons

### `Twitter` is closing on itself

I can't see tweets, accounts, or even the main page without being logged in :
- what's the point of `Twitter` if it becomes accessible only to `Twitter` users ...
- It makes even less sense for advertisements, it limits them to `Twitter` users ... isn't this counter productive ?

If it stays that way ... I don't think I won't even post "post links" there, it will just be work ...

### I like seeing if people click on my links

Yep, the only reason I will use `linkt.ree` is ego boosting.

### Contrasting my website and the outside web

Surfing the web has become paddling in an ocean of :
- ads
- face hugger videos
- hidden video controls
- face hugger windows
- obscure closing buttons (left, right, button okay ? button dismiss ?)
- the button to refuse cookies "do no accept cookies" is either : 
  - written discreetly
  - requiring un-toggling 10 elements, because there are no "refuse all cookies"
  
I will contribute to the pollution, hammering the nail in the ~~personal data exploitation~~ personalized experience, to make my website even more peaceful.

### Blending in the world craziness

Sometimes I want to be normal, to fit the norm.

By doing the same things that big money earners do, relieves the pressure that ethics put on my train of thought.

After all, being crazy in a crazy world, is being normal.

## The way I am doing it

I will refer to the two addresses if I can:
- I don't like the link tree page, for obvious reasons
- I feel bad
- it distorts the perception of who I am
