## *Surviving "happy" or surviving "unhappy" ?*

Working a job that I like with a low income, is surviving.

Working a job that I don't like with a moderate income is surviving. 

Working a job that I don't like with high income and low ethics is surviving.

I am trading time of my life for something, I want that something to be happiness.

Happiness for me only comes if my logic and my feeling are agreeing about choices I make.
