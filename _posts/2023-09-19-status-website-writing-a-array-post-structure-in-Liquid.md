I am emulating a structure from __`Liquid`__ code using arrays and access functions, instead of using __`site.posts`__ directly. 

Problems I have with __`Jekyll`__ posts :
- they are made with a structure that doesn't exist in __`Liquid`__
- they have fields and field access are obscure, I can't waste more time on this
