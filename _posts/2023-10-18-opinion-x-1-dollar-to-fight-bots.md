- bots maker wouldn't most likely be deterred to pay 100$ per year to run 100 bots
- one's identity could be checked with a payment using a credit card number, once, without charges
- one payment even as low as 1$ per year opens the door to future price increases
- paying to use the platform makes it a service/digital product
- social platforms are built on the illusion of freedom, capitalizing on advertisements and user data

Users would become customers, paying for a service while knowingly being used to make money.
