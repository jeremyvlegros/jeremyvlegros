I can't use `Twitter` as a HUB even less, because my links are not public anymore ... or sometimes ?

Tweets, accounts, or even the main page, are inaccessible without being logged in :
- `Twitter` becomes accessible only to `Twitter` users
- It doesn't make sense for advertisements
- some accounts work without login ? paid accounts ?
