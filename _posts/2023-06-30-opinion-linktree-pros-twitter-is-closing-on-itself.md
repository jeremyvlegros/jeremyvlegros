I can't use __`Twitter`__ as a HUB, and now even less, because my links are not public depending on ... unknown factors.

Tweets, accounts, or even the main page, are inaccessible without being logged in :
- __`Twitter`__ becomes accessible only to __`Twitter`__ users
- advertisements only target __`Twitter`__ users, with accounts
- it seems that some accounts work as usual, without me being logged in, paid accounts maybe ?
