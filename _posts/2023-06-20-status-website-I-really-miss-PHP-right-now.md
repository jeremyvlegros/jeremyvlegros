The time I spent searching how Jekyll and Liquid works ... The Liquid syntax ... is ... *sigh* ... the documentations are ... *sigh*.

At this point I have two alternatives :

- 1) don't dive deeper, because I am already drowning
- 2) Install Jekyll locally and test the syntax, until I become fluent

I miss `PHP` badly right now.
