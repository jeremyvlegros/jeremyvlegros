This cost me a lot of sanity  c.f <a href="{{ "post/1695957483470493710" | relative_url }}"> post</a>

I could report those kinds of bugs if :
- I would not lose time by reporting it 
- I would be able to stay calm when they happen
- I was hopeful for a fast resolution 

I am going back to a text editor, it will cost me time, but will separate the sofware errors from the code errors.
