I can't use `Twitter` as a HUB, and now even less, because my links are not public depending on ... unknown factors.

Tweets, accounts, or even the main page, are inaccessible without being logged in :
- `Twitter` becomes accessible only to `Twitter` users
- advertisements only target `Twitter` users, with accounts
- it seems that some accounts work as usual, without me being logged in, paid accounts maybe ?
