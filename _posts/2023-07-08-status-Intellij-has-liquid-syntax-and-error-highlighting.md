It comes with an official plugin, and I didn't know about it because I copied and pasted code from HTML to the "GitHub code editor" ... '(^^).

It is a little bit of relief, because I have to split many `Liquid` files, it took one day to ~~force~~ ready myself. 

Changing the same code part in multiple files, several times, is a mistake engraved vividly in my mind, I can't continue the website until it is done.
