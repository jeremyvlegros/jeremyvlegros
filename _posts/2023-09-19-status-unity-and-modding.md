The fee install policy is the last straw.

It's the same thing again and again, companies decide what makes more money for them, and change policies how they see fit.

I don't want to learn a game engine for modding when it decides that is okay to put developers, games in development, and *even* already released games, at risk.

I will focus on parts that are not in `C#` *sigh*, it's the best compromise I have right now.
