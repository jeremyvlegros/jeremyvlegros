## `Mojang` never ceases to feed the emotional roller coaster beast

`Minecraft` updates, new biomes, new mobs always makes me happier, for a short time :

- a free update every here and then up to this day
- a massive update once a year
- a mob vote each year for one out of three

Updates always feel empty, focusing too much on the world structure and too little about injecting life, resulting in great, static, landscapes.

Each year I wait for the next `Minecraft live`, then wait for the update, then play for a bit, then wait for the next `Minecraft live` ...

It is a disturbing relationship that to have with `Mojang`, the community being lit on fire, and them staying silent.

`Mojang` is accountable for the content they release and during these 10 years `Minecraft` rarely felt like something else than an empty shell.
