A job is always renting my alive time, for money : 

- a job that I like with a low income, is surviving
- a job that I don't like with a moderate income is surviving
- a job that I don't like with high income and low ethics is surviving

In the end I asked myself which one I preferred :
- surviving happy ?
- surviving unhappy ?
