## public access to a timeline  
- still being bugged with sign-in prompts
- when it's allowed (I don't know the conditions since `Twitter` has closed on itself)


## interaction :
- with lots of people
- with lots of known people
- with strangers, including known people
- with lots of companies
- buttons, "like", "bookmark", maybe I can find a use for the "retweet"
- safeguards :
  - can choose who can respond to posts (made me come back at the time)
  - can choose who can message me by setting on only accounts I follow

## fast content consuming : 
- short posts (at the time)
- embedding media is effortless, and comes with a built-in preview
