Public access to a timeline, but ... :
- still nagging people with sign-in prompts
- it's not valid for all timelines, I don't know/understand the viewing rules

Interaction :
- with lots of people :
  - well known
  - strangers
  - companies
- simple buttons "like" "bookmark", "retweet"
- safeguards as people can choose:
  - who can respond to a post (the reason that made me come back at the time)
  - who can message them by setting on only accounts I follow

Fast content consumption : 
- short posts but ... paying people get longer ones
- embedding media is effortless, comes with a built-in preview
