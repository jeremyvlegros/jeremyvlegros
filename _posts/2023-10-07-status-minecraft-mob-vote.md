Voting for free content is a priviledge, however when : 
- it is based on luck, 33.33%
- it discards unvoted features Ã— mobs
- it splits the community
- it's done with scarce information
- it's about features that can be added fast, mostly recycling code
- it's done without answering the community concerns

it becomes a burden that I don't want.
