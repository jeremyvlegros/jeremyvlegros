The website updates :
- it has been under heavy refactoring but changes have not been pushed
- I was trying to build a better workflow by improving the checks on `Liquid`/`Jekyll` code, writing with limited code capabilities due to `Liquid` is very challenging, but I learned a lot from it
- The `Github` problems :
  - `Github pages` has changed, using `actions` has become mandatory, I don't know if this commit will be pushed 
  - the `github` `cli` `GPG` key problem means I have to configure everything by myself with `SSH` if I remember correctly, and I know it would take a long time to do
  - considering leaving `Github` because of the two things above 

The website content :
- I read a lot of social media posts, drama, and it changed my perspective about posting.I won't add more negativity by writing opinions, I will stick to facts, if I still post opinions.
- I am thinking of writing modding tutorials at some point, but it is still unsure
- I am still debating with myself the format of posts in relation with my dream job project(s)

Naming convention & programming style through `Python`:
- I have been working on my naming convention by re-writing code from scratch,now it seems stable enough that my programming has become smooth
- I removed totally the type hint dependency I imposed upon myself, and rewrote type checks
- I still have to work on classes

Day job :
- I am out of job right now, looking for opportunities that require minimum social contact / programming jobs

Dream job :
- my plan has changed many times, mostly the delivering/publishing, now it is more robust and simpler to implement 
- I think that if I were to work in video games, I would be a game designer rather than a game programmer

Modding :
- I have been modding like a madman, until I reached new breaking points, requiring new modding paradigms 
- my vision of what is modding and how it should be done has changed
- my opinion on paid mods also changed, because dedicated platforms were easier, safer, and I was very optimistic about how it would be done 
- mods should always be free to download, although I would be all in for commission work when it is allowed
- I often think about fairness towards modders from : developers;publishers;gamers;fellow modders;the laws.I try to create a workflow to encounter the least of problems, but it implies a lot of sacrificed methods. 

IDE / text editor :
- I bought a `sublime text` licence, It takes care of large files (`python`,`markdown`) without problems
- I am using `Pycharm community` for `Python`, until I can modify `sublime text` enough to become an IDE or choose to install the `anaconda` package
