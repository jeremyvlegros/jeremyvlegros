`Twitter` users can allow third party applications to get a person geolocation, meaning that they can know my location.

I did not have a problem about that because :
- companies know my IP because I have accounts for most of them
- I only followed people that I chose

The problem is that I don't trust `Twitter` abilities to maintain the platform code anymore, and by extension, security.
