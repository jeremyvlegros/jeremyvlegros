I remembered that `Twitter` users can allow third party applications to get a person geolocation, meaning that somebody I follow can know my location.

For some time I was okay with companies being able to know my IP because I have accounts for most of them.

This concession was okay until the rebranding which is worrisome, see post [`#1690880245921914509`](/post/1690880245921914509)

I don't want to use `Twitter`(`X`? `X corp`) for communication anymore, I don't trust their abilities to maintain the platform code, hence, security.
