It will constrast with my website, appearing as even more peaceful :

- no ads
- no face hugger videos
- no hidden video controls
- no face hugger windows
- no obfustated closing windows (left ?, right ?, button okay ? button dismiss ?)
- no refusing cookie button written discreetly, where you are not looking at
- no refusing cookie button requiring the un-toggling one by one, 10+ elements 
- no refusing cookie button enforcing ... mandatory functionality cookies

N.B : I do my best to remove cookies, but some external content such as `Youtube` requires cookies to work ... there are ways to go around them (open source even), but I don't know if they are legal (yet)
