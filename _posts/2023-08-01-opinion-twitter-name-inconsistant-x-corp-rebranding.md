Someparts are kept as `Twitter` and some parts named `X`.

The blue color is still there, whereas the logo is black and white.

The website address is `Twitter` whereas the website is named `X` :
- typing `www.x.com` redirects to `Twitter`, why didn't they do it in one go ?
- the handle `Twitter` was not replaced by `X`, I don't know if it still the case
- for a company this big to do that quality of a rebranding, worries me enough to change my plans about it
