Someparts are kept as __`Twitter`__ and some parts named __`X`__.

The blue color is still there, whereas the logo is black and white.

The website address is __`Twitter`__ whereas the website is named __`X`__ :
- typing __`www.x.com`__ redirects to __`Twitter`__, why didn't they do it in one go ?
- the handle __`Twitter`__ was not replaced by __`X`__, I don't know if it still the case
- for a company this big to do that quality of a rebranding, worries me enough to change my plans about it
