WARNING :
  ONLY WRITE VARIABLES !

GOALS :
  - my variables in one place instead of `_data` x `_config`
  - edition :
    - my brain itches when seeing `<name_in_lowercase>.<variable_name_uppercase>`
    - I don't want to type `site.DEBUG` when I could type `DEBUG` :
      - I use a file template in my IDE that creates a file with `{%- include CONFIGURATION/ALL.liquid -%}`
    - I can find my variables fast
    - I can change values individually
  - preventing cyclic imports, everything variable is split. Imports :
  - clean structure
  - I don't want to find out if it can or can't deal with cyclic redundancy on include/imports :
      -  either happen separately
      -  either happen separately by importing the `ALL`
  - optimizing my functions a little by avoiding computations already made

CONS :
  - does nothing more that the _config.yaml file already does/(can do)
  - implementation is circonvoluted
  - waste : I will most likely never use anything separately
