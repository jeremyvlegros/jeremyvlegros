<h1>Twitter original plan : a HUB</h1>
<hr>

At the time I wanted to use `Twitter` as a HUB and `Tumblr` as a blog.

But my access to Tumblr was bugged with an empty page loading indefinitely, prompting a cookie panel I kept accepting …

So Twitter became a all in one solution.

<h1>What Twitter has and doesn’t have, right now</h1>
<hr>

<p>I will not describe the very many reasons why I stopped posting, and focus on where I think Twitter is right now.</p>

<b><p>without an account :</p></b>
<ul>
	<li> there are no more searching bar, you can’t search for people anymore (it is less public,you can watch the explore without - any control on what you see, when they are matches you see mostly only result matches … great …)</li>
	<li> you can watch the entire timeline of a person without an account (while bugged with login prompts at “x” number of posts)</li>
	<li> you can’t watch the pictures of a person in “Media” but still can click on the picture gallery thing on the right `’(-_-)`</li>
</ul>

<b><p>The CEO has changed :</p></b>
<ul>
	<li> I don’t really know if it will change something at this point if the old CEO still sits not far</li>
</ul>

<b><p>API is restricted :</p></b>
<ul>
	<li> at some point I thought about automating things, I don’t have to ask that to myself anymore, it’s one less problem</li>
</ul>

<b><p>There are no alternatives to what Twitter was about :</p></b>
<ul>
	<li> short posts, embedding media effortlessly, with a preview</li>
	<li> have an identity on the web and at the time, with luck, a verified one</li>
	<li> lots of people, lots of celebrities (oh gosh I don’t like that word)</li>
	<li> lots of companies</li>
	<li> can interact with strangers, specifically people I admire</li>
</ul>

<h1>What I want/need from the Twitter account</h1>
<hr>

<ul>
	<li> I still don’t want to write posts</li>
	<li> I don’t want to waste the posts I made</li>
	<li> removing all the posts while keeping the account is not conceivable</li>
	<li> I am not available to private messages anywhere else because of the “following only” option.Companies can’t contact me swiftly if I do something good or bad</li>
	<li> I want to keep my handle (… what a joyful world)</li>
	<li> I discovered to optimize the use of Twitter</li>
<li> The weather forecast on my personal life has become clouded with dark grey clouds, so I am less about ethics than usual</li>
</ul>

<h1>Conclusion : business, always and forever business</h1>
<hr>

<p>Because I don’t really care about Twitter as a text posting platform anymore, I will do mostly what companies do.</p>

<p>It’s rather sad to think that I will exist there mostly for business communication.</p>

# Twitter original plan : a HUB

What Twitter has and doesn’t have, right now

---

I will not describe the very many reasons why I stopped posting, and focus on where I think Twitter is right now.

without an account :

- there are no more searching bar, you can’t search for people anymore (it is less public,you can watch the explore without - any control on what you see, when they are matches you see mostly only result matches … great …)
- you can watch the entire timeline of a person without an account (while bugged with login prompts at “x” number of posts)
- you can’t watch the pictures of a person in “Media” but still can click on the picture gallery thing on the right `’(-_-)`


The CEO has changed :

- I don’t really know if it will change something at this point if the old CEO still sits not far


API is restricted :

- at some point I thought about automating things, I don’t have to ask that to myself anymore, it’s one less problem


There are no alternatives to what Twitter was about :

- short posts, embedding media effortlessly, with a preview
- have an identity on the web and at the time, with luck, a verified one
- lots of people, lots of celebrities (oh gosh I don’t like that word)
- lots of companies
- can interact with strangers, specifically people I admire


# What I want/need from the Twitter account

- I still don’t want to write posts
- I don’t want to waste the posts I made
- removing all the posts while keeping the account is not conceivable
- I am not available to private messages anywhere else because of the “following only” option.Companies can’t contact me swiftly if I do something good or bad
- I want to keep my handle (… what a joyful world)
- I discovered to optimize the use of Twitter

The weather forecast on my personal life has become clouded with dark grey clouds, so I am less about ethics than usual


# Conclusion : business, always and forever business

Because I don’t really care about Twitter as a text posting platform anymore, I will do mostly what companies do.

It’s rather sad to think that I will exist there mostly for business communication.
