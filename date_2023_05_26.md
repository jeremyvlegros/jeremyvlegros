# Original plan : a HUB

---

At the time I wanted to use `Twitter` as a HUB and `Tumblr` as a blog,

but my access to `Tumblr` was bugged with an empty page loading indefinitely, prompting a cookie panel I kept accepting …

So `Twitter` became a all in one solution.

What `Twitter` has and doesn’t have, right now

---

I will not describe the very many reasons why I stopped posting, and focus on where I think `Twitter` is right now.

**Without an account :**

- there are no more searching bar, you can’t search for people anymore (it is less public,you can watch the explore without - any control on what you see, when they are matches you see mostly only result matches … great …)
- you can watch the entire timeline of a person without an account (while bugged with login prompts at “x” number of posts)
- you can’t watch the pictures of a person in “Media” but still can click on the picture gallery thing on the right `’(-_-)`


**The CEO has changed :**

- I don’t really know if it will change something at this point, the old CEO still sitting not far


**API is restricted :**

- at some point I thought about automating things, I don’t have to ask that to myself anymore, it’s one less problem
- just went on the API page for something else, and there is a free version


**There are no alternatives to what `Twitter` was about :**

- short posts, embedding media effortlessly, with a preview
- have an identity on the web and at the time, with luck, a verified one
- lots of people, lots of celebrities (oh gosh I don’t like that word)
- lots of companies
- can interact with strangers, specifically people I admire


# What I want/need from the Twitter account

---

- I still don’t want to write posts
- ~~I don’t want to waste the posts I made~~ I just wasted them, I don't want to rely on it
- ~~removing all the posts while keeping the account is not conceivable~~ It took me **days**
- I am only available for private messages there because of the `following only` option.Companies can’t contact me swiftly if I do something good or bad
- I want to keep my handle (… what a joyful world)
- I discovered a way to optimize the use of `Twitter`

The weather forecast on my personal life has become clouded with dark grey clouds, so I am less about ethics than usual


# Conclusion : business, always and forever business

---

Because I don’t really care about Twitter as a text posting platform anymore, I will do mostly what companies do.

It’s rather sad to think that I will ~~exist~~ be there mostly for business communication.
