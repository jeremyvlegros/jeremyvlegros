  <h1 id="title"> Me, now </h1>

   <!-- <hr class="hr_h1"> -->

   <p>My name is Jeremy Legros, I am French, and I am going to be 40 years in two years.</p>

   <p>I chose to seek a job where I can thrive, so I am creating my own.</p>

   Nowadays I am writing:
   <ul>
    <li>my library in the Python language</li>
    <li>my naming convention</li>
    <li>my programming paradigms</li>
   </ul>
   <p> and specializing myself in Python programming</p>

<div id="day_job">

<h2> My day job </h2>



   <p>I am self-employed, I help people with anything computer related, this is my day job when I get calls.</p>

   <p>I am still dependent on the help of the government and my parents.</p>

   <p>I am certainly not proud to be in this situation, constantly in fear, in guilt while pushing forward to a future where I can be happy.</p>

   <p>I am creating my own job, while nobody, but me understands what it is about.</p>

<div id="dream_job">

<h2> Building my dream job </h2>

 <p>I don’t have a name for my dream job, the best definition I can come with other than “my job is me” would be : </p>

   <ul>
     <li> I am building a place where I can produce content about everything I do</li>
     <li> automating most of the creation and publishing process </li>
     <li> while publishing about it</li>
     <li> sponsoring my dream job of modding video-games, while building tools for it</li>
   </ul>

</div>

<div id="happy">
<h3> I chose to survive happy </h3>


<p>I’ve been mostly unhappy most of my life.</p>

<p>I was okay floating around, doing what was expected of me if It didn't bother me too much, easing the minds of people worried about me mattered the most, and not taking decisions was mostly easy.</p>

<p>I watched my parents work :</p>

<ul>
  <li>from 8 AM to 3:30PM, five days a week</li>

  <li>coming home talking about work</li>

  <li>bringing work home each day, their remaining time split between house chores, rest, and leisure.</li>

</ul>

<p>The perspective of defining most of my life by my job, prompted serious questions :</p>

<ul>
  <li> What's the point of living a life that's not mine ?</li>
  <li> Is surviving enough ? </li>
  <li> Surviving unhappy or surviving happy ? </li>
</ul>

<div id="job_reality">

 <h3> Job reality </h3>

 <p>I went to two job applications, both not about software development, because I was that desperate.</p>

 <p>The two interviews were distressing experiences, with common points :</p>

 <ul>

  <li>what was asked of me was not in my qualifications nor in the job description</li>

  <li>asking me to do the job of an IT technician full/part time while hiring me under another job title, most likely less paid</li>

 </ul>

 <p>And were distressing in their own ways :</p>

 <ul>

  <li>in the first, I got silly questions and my answers were met with condescendence</li>

  <li>in the second, I failed a practical test that I wasn’t aware nor even qualified for, followed by an oral interview, where I learned the truth about the job </li>

 </ul></div>
<div id="context">

 <h3> context </h3>

 <p>During this period, COVID was at its peak, I still, like a lot of people, took the risk of going out, feeling the fear in my guts, applied for a job in proximity with hundreds of people each day.</p>

 <p>I thought that getting a job was a fair game :</p>

 <ul>

   <li>I have qualifications</li>

   <li>recruiters could ask questions on those qualifications</li>

   <li>I was ready to take tests to prove those qualifications</li>

   <li>I was applying for a job, matching the job description</li>

 </ul></div>

  <h2> 2018 - 2021 </h2>

  <p>I went back and forth in the French governmental employment system, looking a job as a software developer (not WEB).</p>

  <p>I lowered my expectations again and again until I applied to two jobs that weren’t not about developers.</p></div>

<div id="date_2016_2018">

 <h2> 2016 - 2018 </h2>

 <p>I went back to university at the age of 31 finish my bachelor degree in computer science.</p>

 <p>During the first year, I kept dispensing courses at a much lower frequency until my high-school students earned their baccalaureate, and closed my business some time after.</p>

 <p>When I got my diploma I went on a software developer job hunt.</p></div>
