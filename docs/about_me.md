I am French, and I am going to be 40 years in two years.

I chose to seek a job where I can thrive, so I am creating my own.


## Where I come from

### Until 2017

I was self-employed, helping high school students to get back on their wheels.

### 2017 - 2018

I went back to university at the age of 32 to get my bachelor degree in computer science.

During the first year, I kept dispensing courses at a much lower frequency until my students earned their baccaulerat.

I got my diploma and went on a developer job hunt.

### 2018 - 2020

I went back and forth in the French governemental employement system, looking a job as a developper (not WEB).

I lowered my expectations again and again until I candidated to two jobs that weren't not about developers.

#### context

During this period, COVID was at its peak, I still, like a lot of people, took the risk of going out, feeling the fear in my guts, candidating for a job in proximity with hundreds of people each day.

I thought that getting a job was a fair game :
- I have qualifications
- recruters can ask questions on those qualifications
- I was ready to take tests to prove those qualifications
- I didn't candidate for a job description not matching my qualifications

#### job reality

I went to two job applications, both not about developing because I was that desesperate.

The two interviews were distressing experiences, with common points :
- what was asked of me was not in my qualifications nor in the job description
- asking me to do the job of an IT technician full/part time while hiring me under another "lesser" job title

And were humiliating in their own ways :
- in the first I was treated like a fool, and I only protested to my friend afterwards that I should have left
- in the second, I failed a practical test that I wasn't aware nor even qualified for, followed by an oral interview, where I learned the truth about the job


#### Choice

I've been mostly unhappy most of my life.

I floated around, doing what was best in regards to what I wanted and what could ease the minds of people who worried about me.

The perspective to be stuck forever with a job that I don't feel happy in, popped a serious question, what do I prefer between :

- being paid okay, suffer 8 hours a day, 7 days a week
- being paid poorly, suffer 8 hours a day, 7 days a week, but being happy doing it

to resume, to choose between :
- surviving unhappy
- surviving happy

I chose to survive happy.

The main decision factor was that after work hours I would just rest, hence describing what I would do in working hours would just be describing my life.

If my life time is just unhappy meaningless hours, what does it tell about its worth ?


## Where I am today

### My official job

I am self-employed again, I help people with anything computer related, this is my day job when I get calls.

I am still dependent on the help of the government and my parents.

I am certainly not proud to be in this situation, constantly in fear, in guilt while pushing forward to a future where I can be happy.

I am creating my own job, while nobody, but me understands what it is about.

### Building my dream job

I don't have a name for it, if I were to define what it is, I would say that "my job is me", but it doesn't make much sense does it ?.

I am building a place where I can produce content about everything I do, automating most of the creation and publishing process, while publishing about it.

This is the best definition I can come with right now.

The goal of all of this being to be able to sponsor my dream job while building tools for it : modding video-games
