<h1 style="font-variant: small-caps;color:#00b8ff;"> About me </h1>

<hr>

<p>I am French, and I am going to be 40 years in two years.</p>

<p>I chose to seek a job where I can thrive, so I am creating my own.</p>

<h1 style="font-variant: small-caps;color:#00b8ff;">  Where I am today </h1>

<hr>

<h2 style="text-decoration: underline;font-variant: small-caps;color:#123;"> My official job </h2>

<hr>

<p>I am self-employed, I help people with anything computer related, this is my day job when I get calls.</p>

<p>I am still dependent on the help of the government and my parents.</p>

<p>I am certainly not proud to be in this situation, constantly in fear, in guilt while pushing forward to a future where I can be happy.</p>

<p>I am creating my own job, while nobody, but me understands what it is about.</p>

<h2 style="text-decoration: underline;font-variant: small-caps;color:#123;"> Building my dream job </h2>

<hr>

<p>I don’t have a name for it, if I were to define what it is, I would say that “my job is me”, but it doesn’t make much sense does it ?.</p>

<p>I am building a place where I can produce content about everything I do, automating most of the creation and publishing process, while publishing about it.</p>

<p>This is the best definition I can come with, right now.</p>

<p>The goal of all of this being to be able to sponsor my dream job while building tools for it, modding video-games.</p>

<h1 style="font-variant: small-caps;color:#00b8ff;"> Where I come from </h1>

<hr>

<h2 style="text-decoration: underline;font-variant: small-caps;color:#123;"> Until 2017 </h2>

<hr>

<p>I was self-employed, helping high school students to get back on their wheels.</p>

<h2 style="text-decoration: underline;font-variant: small-caps;color:#123;"> 2017 - 2018 </h2>

<hr>

<p>I went back to university at the age of 32 to get my bachelor degree in computer science.</p>

<p>During the first year, I kept dispensing courses at a much lower frequency until my students earned their baccalaureate.</p>

<p>I got my diploma and went on a developer job hunt.</p>

<h2 style="text-decoration: underline;font-variant: small-caps;color:#123;"> 2018 - 2020 </h2>

<hr>

<p>I went back and forth in the French governmental employment system, looking a job as a software developer (not WEB).</p>

<p>I lowered my expectations again and again until I applied to two jobs that weren’t not about developers.</p>

<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;font-variant: small-caps;color:#456;"> Context </h3>

<p>During this period, COVID was at its peak, I still, like a lot of people, took the risk of going out, feeling the fear in my guts, applied for a job in proximity with hundreds of people each day.</p>

<p>I thought that getting a job was a fair game :</p>

<ul>

  <li>I have qualifications</li>

  <li>recruiters can ask questions on those qualifications</li>

  <li>I was ready to take tests to prove those qualifications</li>

  <li>I didn’t candidate for a job description not matching my qualifications</li>

</ul>

<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;font-variant: small-caps;color:#456;"> Job reality </h3>

<p>I went to two job applications, both not about software development, because I was that desperate.</p>

<p>The two interviews were distressing experiences, with common points :</p>

<ul>

  <li>what was asked of me was not in my qualifications nor in the job description</li>

  <li>asking me to do the job of an IT technician full/part time while hiring me under another job title, most likely less paid</li>

</ul>

<p>And were distressing in their own ways :</p>

<ul>

  <li>in the first, I got silly questions and my answers were met with condescendence</li>

  <li>in the second, I failed a practical test that I wasn’t aware nor even qualified for, followed by an oral interview, where I learned the truth about the job </li>

</ul>

<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;font-variant: small-caps;color:#456;"> I chose to survive happy </h3>

<p>I’ve been mostly unhappy most of my life.</p>

<p>I floated around, doing what was best in regards to what I wanted and what could ease the minds of people who worried about me.</p>

<p>The perspective to be stuck forever with a job that I don’t feel happy in, prompted a serious question, what do I prefer between :</p>

<ul>

  <li> being paid okay & suffer 8 hours a day & 7 days a week</li>

  <li> being paid poorly & suffer 8 hours a day & 7 days a week & happy</li>

</ul>

<p>It was choosing between, surviving unhappy and surviving happy.</p>

<p>I watched my parents work :</p>

<ul>
  <li>from 8 AM to 3PM, six days a week</li>

  <li>coming home talking about work</li>

  <li>their remaining time was split between finishing more work brought home, house work, rest, and leisure.</li>

</ul>

<p>If most of my life hours are work hours, they sure have to matter to me, I can't stand meaningless for too long.</p>
