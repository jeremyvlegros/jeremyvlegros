<p style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">I am French, and I am going to be 40 years in two years.</p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">I chose to seek a job where I can thrive, so I am creating my own.</p>

<h1 style="color:#00b8ff;font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;"> Where I come from </h1>

<h2 style="color:#123;font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;"> Until 2017 </h2>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">I was self-employed, helping high school students to get back on their wheels.</p>

<h2 style="color:#123;font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;"> 2017 - 2018 </h2>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">I went back to university at the age of 32 to get my bachelor degree in computer science.</p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">During the first year, I kept dispensing courses at a much lower frequency until my students earned their baccaulerat.</p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">I got my diploma and went on a developer job hunt.</p>

<h2 style="color:#123;font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;"> 2018 - 2020 </h2>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">I went back and forth in the French governemental employement system, looking a job as a developper (not WEB).</p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">I lowered my expectations again and again until I candidated to two jobs that weren’t not about developers.</p>

<h3 style="color:#456;font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;"> context </h3>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">During this period, COVID was at its peak, I still, like a lot of people, took the risk of going out, feeling the fear in my guts, candidating for a job in proximity with hundreds of people each day.</p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">I thought that getting a job was a fair game :</p>
<ul>
  <li style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">I have qualifications</li>
  <li style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">recruters can ask questions on those qualifications</li>
  <li style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">I was ready to take tests to prove those qualifications</li>
  <li style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">I didn’t candidate for a job description not matching my qualifications</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="color:#456;font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;"> job reality </h3>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">I went to two job applications, both not about developing because I was that desesperate.</p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">The two interviews were distressing experiences, with common points :</p>
<ul>
  <li style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">what was asked of me was not in my qualifications nor in the job description</li>
  <li style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">asking me to do the job of an IT technician full/part time while hiring me under another “lesser” job title</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">And were humiliating in their own ways :</p>
<ul>
  <li style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">in the first I was treated like a fool, and I only protested to my friend afterwards that I should have left</li>
  <li style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">in the second, I failed a practical test that I wasn’t aware nor even qualified for, followed by an oral interview, where I learned the truth about the job</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="color:#456;font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;"> Choice </h3>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">I’ve been mostly unhappy most of my life.</p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">I floated around, doing what was best in regards to what I wanted and what could ease the minds of people who worried about me.</p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">The perspective to be stuck forever with a job that I don’t feel happy in, popped a serious question, what do I prefer between :</p>

<ul>
  <li style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">being paid okay, suffer 8 hours a day, 7 days a week</li>
  <li style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">being paid poorly, suffer 8 hours a day, 7 days a week, but being happy doing it</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">to resume, to choose between :</p>
<ul>
  <li style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">surviving unhappy</li>
  <li style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">surviving happy</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">I chose to survive happy.</p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">The main decision factor was that after work hours I would just rest, hence describing what I would do in working hours would just be describing my life.</p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">If my life time is just unhappy meaningless hours, what does it tell about its worth ?</p>

<h1 style="color:#00b8ff;font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">  Where I am today </h1>

<h2 style="color:#123;font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;"> My official job </h2>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">I am self-employed again, I help people with anything computer related, this is my day job when I get calls.</p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">I am still dependent on the help of the government and my parents.</p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">I am certainly not proud to be in this situation, constantly in fear, in guilt while pushing forward to a future where I can be happy.</p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">I am creating my own job, while nobody, but me understands what it is about.</p>

<h2 style="color:#123;font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;"> Building my dream job </h2>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">I don’t have a name for it, if I were to define what it is, I would say that “my job is me”, but it doesn’t make much sense does it ?.</p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">I am building a place where I can produce content about everything I do, automating most of the creation and publishing process, while publishing about it.</p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">This is the best definition I can come with right now.</p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;">The goal of all of this being to be able to sponsor my dream job while building tools for it : modding video-games</p>
