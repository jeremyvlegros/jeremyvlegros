# oh boy ... I had to go there https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll

# where I found after some more effort that https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/default/
# which is not even enough
# It is literaly my life to search for documentation instead of programming, oh, wait ... there is not what I am looking for
