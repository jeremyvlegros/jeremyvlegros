# do you believe that it is infinitly faster to hack the code spawned in the HTML to get YAML variables than to find help on it ... 
# oh boy ... I had to go there https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll 
# which sent me there https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/
# where I found after some more effort that https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/default/
# which is not even enough
# It is literaly my life to search for documentation instead of programming, oh, wait ... there is not what I am looking for
# ... what a pain... I will put a dirty style tag in my markdown I don't care anymore
