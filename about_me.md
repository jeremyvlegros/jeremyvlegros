My name is Jeremy Legros, I am French, 38 years old.

I chose to seek a job where I can thrive, so I am creating my own.

Currently I am :

- writing my library in the Python language / specializing myself in Python programming
- writing my naming convention
- writing my programming style paradigms
- writing my own website

### 2021 - now

#### My day job

I am :

- self-employed, I help people with anything computer related, this is my day job when I get calls.
- still dependent on the help of the government and my parents.
- certainly not proud to be in this situation, constantly in fear, in guilt while pushing forward to a future where I can be happy.

#### Building my dream job

I don’t have a name for my dream job.

The best definition I can come with, other than “basically it's me” would be a workshop :

- where I register almost everything I do
- automate most the creation and publishing process, by creating tools and a pipeline × workflow
- publish about the publishing process

In the one goal of sponsoring my dream job of modding video-games


### 2018 - 2021

I went back and forth in the French governmental employment system, looking a job as a software developer (not WEB).

I lowered my expectations again and again until I applied to two jobs that weren’t not about developers.


#### Job reality

I went to two job applications, both not about software development, because I was that desperate.

The two interviews were distressing experiences, with common points :

- what was asked of me was not in my qualifications nor in the job description

- asking me to do the job of an IT technician full/part time while hiring me under another job title, most likely less paid


Those interviews were distressing in their own ways :

- in the first, I got silly questions and my answers were met with condescendence

- in the second, I failed a practical test that I wasn’t aware nor even qualified for, followed by an oral interview, where I learned the truth about the job

#### context

During this period, COVID was at its peak, I still, like a lot of people, took the risk of going out, feeling the fear in my guts, applied for a job in proximity with hundreds of people each day.

I thought that getting a job was a fair game :

 - I have qualifications

 - recruiters could ask questions on those qualifications

 - I was ready to take tests to prove those qualifications

 - I was applying for a job, matching the job description

### 2016 - 2018

I went back to university at the age of 31 finish my bachelor degree in computer science.

During the first year, I kept dispensing courses at a much lower frequency until my high-school students earned their baccalaureate, and closed my business some time after.

When I got my diploma I went on a software developer job hunt.

### 2016

I was self-employed, helping high school students to get back on their wheels.

### I chose to survive happy

I’ve been mostly unhappy most of my life.

For at time I was okay just floating around, doing what was expected of me if It didn't bother me too much.

Plus, if it eased the minds of people worried about me, taking decisions was mostly easy.

I began wanting something more in my life when I fought for my student dreams and see them renouncing in the end, I asked myself what would I have done if I were them.

Then I thought the right now, me, and the most pertinent work example I had, my parents.

I watched my parents work from 8 AM to 3:30PM, five days a week, coming home talking about work bringing work home each day.

Their remaining off work was split between house chores, rest, and leisure.

The perspective of having my life defined into 8 hours of work that I wouldn't like, prompted some serious questions :

-  What's the point of living a life that is not mine ?
-  This is not living, this is surviving : is surviving enough ?
-  In the end the choice is about : surviving unhappy or surviving happy ?
