# Twitter original plan : a HUB

At the time I wanted to use `Twitter` as a HUB and `Tumblr` as a blog.

But my access to Tumblr was bugged with an empty page loading indefinitely, prompting a cookie panel I kept accepting …

So Twitter became a all in one solution.

# What Twitter has and doesn’t have, right now

I will not describe the very many reasons why I stopped posting, and focus on where I think Twitter is right now.

without an account :

- there are no more searching bar, you can’t search for people anymore => it is less public | you can watch the explore without - any control on what you see, when they are matches you see mostly only result matches … great …
- you can watch the entire timeline of a person without an account (while bugged with login prompts at “x” number of posts)
- you can’t watch the pictures of a person in “Media” but still can click on the picture gallery thing on the right `’(-_-)`

the CEO has changed :

- I don’t really know if it will change something at this point if the old CEO still sits not far

API is restricted :

- at some point I thought about automating things, I don’t have to ask that to myself anymore, it’s one less problem

There are no alternatives to what Twitter was about :

- short posts, embedding media effortlessly, with a preview
- have an identity on the web and at the time, with luck, a verified one
- lots of people, lots of celebrities (oh gosh I don’t like that word)
- lots of companies
- can interact with strangers, specifically people I admire

# What I want/need from the Twitter account

- I still don’t want to write posts

- I don’t want to waste the posts I made

- removing all the posts while keeping the account is not conceivable

- I am not available to private messages anywhere else because of the “following only” option.Companies can’t contact me swiftly if I do something good or bad

- I want to keep my handle (… what a joyful world)

- I discovered to optimize the use of Twitter

- The weather forecast on my personal life has become clouded with dark grey clouds, so I am less about ethics than usual

# Conclusion : business, always and forever business

Because I don’t really care about Twitter as a text posting platform anymore, I will do mostly what companies do.

It’s rather sad to think that I will exist there mostly for business communication.
